#Difficulty: M
# Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one,
# which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

#You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

#Example1:
# Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 2]
# Output: 3

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 99]
# Output: 99

# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
# -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
# Each
# element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once
